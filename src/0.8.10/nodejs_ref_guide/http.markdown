## http

> Stability: 3 - Stable

The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the
protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large,
possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer
entire requests or responses—the user is always able to stream data. To use the
HTTP server and client, add `require('http')` to your code.

HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:

    { 'content-length': '123',
      'content-type': 'text/plain',
      'connection': 'keep-alive',
      'accept': 'text/plain' }

Keys are lowercased, and values are not modifiable.

In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node's HTTP
API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only.
It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual
headers or the body.


For more information, read [this article on how to create HTTP
servers](../nodejs_dev_guide/creating_an_http_server.html).

#### Example: The famous hello world

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.js?&linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>


### http.get(options, callback())
- options {Object}  Options to pass to the request
- callback {Function}   The callback to execute once the method finishes 

Since most requests are GET requests without bodies, Node.js provides this
convenience method. The only difference between this method and [[http.request
`http.request()`]] is that it sets the method to GET and calls `req.end()`
automatically.

#### Example

    http.get("http://www.google.com/index.html", function(res) {
      console.log("Got response: " + res.statusCode);
    }).on('error', function(e) {
      console.log("Got error: " + e.message);
    });


### http.STATUS_CODES, Object

A collection of all the standard HTTP response status codes, and the
short description of each.  For example, `http.STATUS_CODES[404] === 'Not
Found'`.


### http.createServer(callback(request, response)), http.Server
- callback {Function}  A callback that is automatically added to the `'request'` event
- request {http.ClientRequest}   Any options you want to pass to the server
- response {http.ClientResponse}  An optional listener

Returns a new web server object.

### http.createClient( [port], [host] )
- port {Number}  The port to listen to
- host {String}   The hostname to listen to
(deprecated)

This function is **deprecated**; please use
[[http.request http.request()]] instead. 

Constructs a new HTTP client. `port` and `host` refer to the server to be
connected to.

### http.globalAgent, http.Agent

This is the global instance of [[http.Agent `http.Agent`]] which is used as the
default for all HTTP client requests.

 


### http.globalAgent.requests, Object

An object which contains queues of requests that have not yet been assigned to 
sockets. **Don't modify this!**




### http.request(options, callback(response)), http.ClientRequest
- options {Object | String}  Options to pass to the request; is a string, it's
parsed with [[url.parse `url.parse()`]]
- callback {Function}   The callback to execute once the method finishes
- response {http.ClientRequest}  The server's response, including headers and
status code

Node.js maintains several connections per server to make HTTP requests. This
function allows one to transparently issue requests.  

The `options` align with the return value of [[url.parse `url.parse()`]]:

- `host`: a domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to.
Defaults to `'localhost'`.
- `hostname`: To support `url.parse()`, `hostname` is preferred over `host`
- `port`: the port of the remote server. Defaults to `80`.
- `localAddress`: local interface to bind for network connections.
- `socketPath`: the Unix Domain Socket (in other words, use either `host:port`
or `socketPath`)
- `method`: a string specifying the HTTP request method. Defaults to `'GET'`.
- `path`: the request path. Defaults to `'/'`. This should include a query
string (if any) For example, `'/index.html?page=12'`
- `headers`: an object containing request headers
- `auth`: used for basic authentication. For example, `'user:password'` computes
an Authorization header.
- `agent`: this controls [[http.Agent `http.Agent`]] behavior. When an Agent is
used, the request defaults to `Connection: keep-alive`. The possible values are:
 -- `undefined`: uses [[http.globalAgent the global agent]] for this host
   and port (default).
 -- `Agent` object: explicitly use the passed in `Agent`
 -- `false`: opt out of connection pooling with an `Agent`, and default the
request to `Connection: close`.

There are a few special headers that should be noted.

* Sending a `'Connection: keep-alive'` notifies Node.js that the connection to
the server should be persisted until the next request.

* Sending a `'Content-length'` header disables the default chunked encoding.

* Sending an 'Expect' header immediately sends the request headers.
  Usually, when sending `'Expect: 100-continue'`, you should both set a timeout
  and listen for the `continue` event. For more information, see [RFC2616
Section 8.2.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.2.3).

* Sending an Authorization header overrides using the `auth` option to compute
basic authentication.

#### Example

    var options = {
      host: 'www.google.com',
      port: 80,
      path: '/upload',
      method: 'POST'
    };

    var req = http.request(options, function(res) {
      console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
      console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (chunk) {
        console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
      });
    });

    req.on('error', function(e) {
      console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
    });

    // write data to request body
    req.write('data\n');
    req.write('data\n');
    req.end();

Note that in the example, `req.end()` was called. With `http.request()` one must
always call `req.end()` to signify that you're done with the request—even if
there is no data being written to the request body.

#### Returns

An instance of the `http.ClientRequest` class. The `ClientRequest` instance is a
writable stream. If one needs to upload a file with a POST request, then write
it to the `ClientRequest` object.

If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution, TCP
level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an `'error'` event is emitted on the
returned request object.

  



## http.Agent

Starting with Node.js 0.5.3, there's a new implementation of the HTTP
Agent which is used for pooling sockets used in HTTP client requests.

Previously, a single agent instance helped pool for a single host+port. The
current implementation now holds sockets for any number of hosts.

The current HTTP Agent also defaults client requests to using
`Connection:keep-alive`. If no pending HTTP requests are waiting on a socket to
become free ,the socket is closed. This means that Node's pool has the benefit
of keep-alive when under load but still does not require developers to manually
close the HTTP clients using keep-alive.

Sockets are removed from the agent's pool when the socket emits either a
`'close'` event or a special `'agentRemove'` event. This means that if you
intend to keep one HTTP request open for a long time and don't want it to stay
in the pool you can do something along the lines of:

    http.get(options, function(res) {
      // Do stuff
    }).on("socket", function (socket) {
      socket.emit("agentRemove");
    });

Alternatively, you could just opt out of pooling entirely using `agent:false`:


    http.get({host:'localhost', port:80, path:'/', agent:false}, function (res)
    {
      // Do stuff
    });






### http.Agent.maxSockets, Number

Determines how many concurrent sockets the agent can have open per host. By
default, this is set to 5. 




### http.Agent.sockets, Number

An object which contains arrays of sockets currently in use by the Agent.
**Don't modify this!**

 

## http.Server

A representation of the server within the `http` module. To create an HTTP
server, you'll need to first call [[http.createServer `http.createServer()`]],
with something like this:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

This object is also an [[eventemitter `eventemitter`]].

For more information, read [this article on how to create HTTP
servers](../nodejs_dev_guide/creating_an_http_server.html).


### http.Server@request(request, response)
- request {http.ServerRequest} An instance of [[http.ServerRequest]]
- response {http.ServerResponse} An instance of [[http.ServerResponse]]

Emitted each time there is a request. Note that, in the case of keep-alive
connections, there may be multiple requests per connection.


### http.Server@connection(socket)
- socket {net.Socket}  An object of type [[net.Socket `net.Socket`]]

Emitted when a new TCP stream is established. Usually users won't want to access
this event. The `socket` can also be accessed at
[[http.ServerRequest.connection]].

 


### http.Server@close(socket)
- socket {net.Socket}  An object of type [[net.Socket `net.Socket`]]

 Emitted when the server closes.



### http.Server@checkContinue(request, response)
- request  {http.ServerRequest} An instance of `http.ServerRequest`
- response {http.ServerResponse}  An instance of `http.ServerResponse`

Emitted each time a request with an `http Expect: 100-continue` is received. If
this event isn't listened for, the server will automatically respond with a `100
Continue` as appropriate.

Handling this event involves calling `response.writeContinue` if the client
should continue to send the request body, or generating an appropriate HTTP
response (_e.g._ `400 Bad Request`) if the client should not continue to send
the request body.

Note: When this event is emitted and handled, the `request` event is not emitted.


### http.Server@connect(request, socket, head)
- request  {http.ServerRequest} An instance of `http.ServerRequest`, that
are the arguments for the http request
- socket {net.Socket} The network socket between the server and client.
- head {Buffer} The first packet of the tunneling stream; this may be empty.

This event is emitted each time a client requests a http CONNECT method. If this 
event isn't
listened for, then clients requesting a CONNECT method will have their
connections closed.

* `request` is , as it is in the request
  event.
* `socket` is t
* `head` is an instance of Buffer, 

After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a `data`
event listener, meaning you will need to bind to it in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.


### http.Server@upgrade(request, socket, head)
- request {http.ServerRequest}  The arguments for the http request, as it is in
the request event
- socket {Number}  The network socket between the server and client
- head {Buffer}   The first packet of the upgraded stream; this can be empty

Emitted each time a client requests a http upgrade. If this event isn't listened
for, then clients requesting an upgrade will have their connections closed.

After this event is emitted, the request's socket won't have a `data` event
listener, meaning you will need to bind to it in order to handle data sent to
the server on that socket.




### http.Server@clientError(exception)
- exception {Error}  The exception being thrown

If a client connection emits an `'error'` event, it's forwarded here.




### http.Server.listen(port [, hostname] [, backlog=511] [, callback()]) 
### http.Server.listen(port [, callback()]) 
### http.Server.listen(handle [, callback()]) 
- port {Number}  The port to listen to
- hostname {String}   The hostname to listen to
- backlog {Number} The maximum length of the queue of pending connections.
- callback {Function} The function to execute once the server has been bound
to the port
- handle {Object} Either a server or socket (anything with an underlying 
`_handle` member), or a `{fd: <n>}` object
(related to: net.Server.listen)

Begin accepting connections on the specified port and hostname. If the hostname
is omitted, the server accepts connections directed to any IPv4 address
(`INADDR_ANY`). To listen to a Unix socket, supply a filename instead of port
and hostname.

**If using the `backlog` signature**: The actual length for `backlog` is 
determined by your OS through sysctl` settings such as `tcp_max_syn_backlog` and 
`somaxconn` on linux. The default value of this parameter is 511 (not 512).

**If using the `handle` signature: This causes the server to accept connections 
on the specified handle, but it is presumed that the file descriptor or handle
has already been bound to a port or domain socket.

Listening on a file descriptor is not supported on Windows.

This function is asynchronous. The `callback()` is added as a listener for the
[[net.Server@listening `net.Server`'s `'listening'`]] event.


### http.Server.close([callback()])
- callback {Function} A function to call once the server closes
(related to: net.Server.close)

Stops the server from accepting new connections.
 
### http.Server.maxHeadersCount, Number

Limits the maximum incoming headers count. The default is 1000. If set to 
0, then no limit is applied.

## http.ServerRequest

This object is created internally by an HTTP server—not by the user—and passed
as the first argument to a `'request'` listener.

The request implements the [[stream.ReadableStream Readable Stream]] interface;
it is also an [[eventemitter `eventemitter`]] with the following events:



### http.ServerRequest@data(chunk)
- chunk {String}  The data that's received (as a string)

Emitted when a piece of the message body is received. The chunk is a string if
an encoding has been set with [[http.ServerRequest.setEncoding
`request.setEncoding()`]], otherwise it's a [[Buffer]].

Note that the **data will be lost** if there is no listener when a
`ServerRequest` emits a `'data'` event.


### http.ServerRequest@end()

Emitted exactly once for each request. After that, no more `'data'` events are
emitted on the request.



### http.ServerRequest@close()

Indicates that the underlaying connection was terminated before `response.end()`
was called or able to flush.

Just like `'end'`, this event occurs only once per request, and no more `'data'`
events will fire afterwards.

Note: `'close'` can fire after `'end'`, but not vice versa.


read-only
### http.ServerRequest.method, String

The request method as a string, like `'GET'` or `'DELETE'`.





### http.ServerRequest.url, String

Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual
HTTP request. Fo example, if the request is:

    GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Accept: text/plain\r\n
    \r\n

Then `request.url` becomes:

    '/status?name=ryan'

#### Example

If you would like to parse the URL into its parts, you can use
`require('url').parse(request.url)`. For example:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.serverrequest_1.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

If you would like to extract the params from the query string, you can use
[[querystring.parse `require('querystring').parse()`]], or pass `true` as the
second argument to `require('url').parse`.  For example:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.serverrequest_2.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>


### http.ServerRequest.headers, Object
(read-only)

Returns a mapping  of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased.

#### Example

    // Prints something like:
    //
    // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0',
    //   host: '127.0.0.1:8000',
    //   accept: '*/*' }
    console.log(request.headers);



### http.ServerRequest.trailers, Object

Contains the HTTP trailers (if present). Only populated after the `'end'` event.



### http.ServerRequest.httpVersion, String
(read-only)

The HTTP protocol version as a string; for example: `'1.1'`, `'1.0'`.
`request.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and `request.httpVersionMinor`
is the second.





### http.ServerRequest.setEncoding([encoding=null])
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use, either `'utf8'` or `'binary'`

Set the encoding for the request body. Defaults to `null`, which means that the
`'data'` event emits a `Buffer` object.


For more information, see 
[[stream.ReadableStream.setEncoding `stream.ReadableStream.setEncoding()`]].


### http.ServerRequest.pause()

Pauses request from emitting events.  Useful to throttle back an upload.  



### http.ServerRequest.resume()

Resumes a paused request.




### http.ServerRequest.connection, net.Socket

The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection.

With HTTPS support, use `request.connection.verifyPeer()` and
`request.connection.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication
details.





## http.ServerResponse

This object is created internally by a HTTP server—not by the user. It is passed
as the second parameter to the `'request'` event. It is a
[[stream.WritableStream `Writable Stream`]].




### http.ServerResponse@close()

If emitted, it it indicates that the underlaying connection was terminated
before `response.end()` was called or able to flush.




### http.ServerResponse.writeContinue()

Sends an `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` message to the client, indicating that the
request body should be sent. For more information, see the
[[http.Server@checkContinue `http.Server`'s `'checkContinue'`]] event.




### http.ServerResponse.writeHead(statusCode [, reasonPhrase] [, headers])
- statusCode {Number}   The 3-digit HTTP status code, like `404`
- reasonPhrase {String}  A human-readable string describing the status
- headers {Object}  Any response headers

Sends a response header to the request.

This method must only be called once on a message and it must be called before
`response.end()` is called.

If you call `response.write()` or `response.end()` before calling this, the
implicit/mutable headers will be calculated and call this function for you.

#### Example 

    var body = 'hello world';
    response.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Length': body.length,
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

Note: `Content-Length` is given in bytes, not characters. The above example works because the string `'hello world'` contains only single byte characters. If the body contains higher coded characters then `Buffer.byteLength()` should be used to determine the number of bytes in a given encoding. Node.js does not check whether `Content-Length` and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.


### http.ServerResponse.statusCode, Number

When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly),
this property controls the status code that are sent to the client when the
headers get flushed; for example: `response.statusCode = 404;`. 

After the response header is sent to the client, this property indicates the
status code which was sent out.





### http.ServerResponse.setHeader(name, value)
- name {String}  The name of the header to set
- value {String} The value to set

Sets a single header value for implicit headers. If this header already exists
in the to-be-sent headers, its value is replaced.  Use an array of strings here
if you need to send multiple headers with the same name.

#### Examples

    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");

    response.setHeader("Set-Cookie", ["type=ninja", "language=javascript"]);


### http.ServerResponse.sendDate, Boolean

When `true`, the Date header is automatically generated and sent in 
the response if it is not already present in the headers. The default is `true`.

This should only be disabled for testing; HTTP requires the Date header
in responses.


### http.ServerResponse.getHeader(name), String
- name {String}  The name of the header to retrieve

Reads out a header that's already been queued but not sent to the client.  Note
that the name is case-insensitive.  This can only be called before headers get
implicitly flushed.

#### Example

    var stringContentType = response.getHeader('content-type');




### http.ServerResponse.removeHeader(name)
- name {String}  The header to remove

Removes a header that's queued for implicit sending.

#### Example

    response.removeHeader("Content-Encoding");




### http.ServerResponse.write(chunk [, encoding='utf8']), Boolean
- chunk {String | Buffer}  A string or buffer to write
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use (if `chunk` is a string)
+ {Boolean} Returns `true` if the entire data was flushed successfully to the 
kernel buffer. Returns `false` if all or part of the data was queued in 
user memory. `'drain'` is emitted when the buffer is again free.

If this method is called and `response.writeHead()` has not been called, it'll
switch to implicit header mode and flush the implicit headers.

This sends a chunk of the response body. This method may be called multiple
times to provide successive parts of the body.

Note: This is the raw HTTP body and has nothing to do with higher-level multi-part body encodings that may be used.

The first time `response.write()` is called, it sends the buffered header
information and the first body to the client. The second time `response.write()`
is called, Node.js assumes you're going to be streaming data, and sends that
separately. That is, the response is buffered up to the first chunk of body.





### http.ServerResponse.addTrailers(headers)
- headers {String}  The trailing header to add

This method adds HTTP trailing headers (a header, but at the end of the message)
to the response.

Trailers are only emitted if chunked encoding is used for the response; if it is
not (_e.g._ if the request was `'HTTP/1.0'`), they are silently discarded.

#### Example

HTTP requires the `Trailer` header to be sent if you intend to emit trailers,
with a list of the header fields in its value. For example:

    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
                              'Trailer': 'Content-MD5' });
    response.write(fileData);
    response.addTrailers({'Content-MD5': "7895bf4b8828b55ceaf47747b4bca667"});
    response.end();





### http.ServerResponse.end([data] [, encoding])
- data {String}  Some data to write before finishing
- encoding {String}  The encoding for the data

This method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body have
been sent; that server should consider this message complete. `response.end()`
**must** be called on each response.

If `data` is specified, it is equivalent to calling `response.write(data,
encoding)` followed by `response.end()`.






## http.ClientRequest

This object is created internally and returned from [[http.request
`http.request()`]].  It represents an _in-progress_ request whose header has
already been queued.  The header is still mutable using the `setHeader(name,
value)`, `getHeader(name)`, and `removeHeader(name)` methods.  The actual header
will be sent along with the first data chunk or when closing the connection.
This is both a [[stream.WritableStream `Writable Stream`]] and an
[[eventemitter `EventEmitter`]].

To get the response, add a listener for `'response'` to the request object.
`'response'` will be emitted from the request object when the response headers
have been received.  The `'response'` event is executed with one argument which
is an instance of `http.ClientResponse`.

During the `'response'` event, one can add listeners to the response object,
particularly to listen for the `'data'` event. Note that the `'response'` event
is called before any part of the response body is received, so there is no need
to worry about racing to catch the first part of the body. As long as a listener
for `'data'` is added during the `'response'` event, the entire body will be
caught.

Note: Node.js does not check whether `Content-Length`and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.


The request implements the [[stream.WritableStream Writable Stream]] interface. 


#### Example

    // Good
    request.on('response', function (response) {
      response.on('data', function (chunk) {
        console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
      });
    });

    // Bad - misses all or part of the body
    request.on('response', function (response) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        response.on('data', function (chunk) {
          console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
        });
      }, 10);
    });


### http.ClientRequest@response(response)
- response {http.ClientResponse}  An instance of [[http.ClientResponse 
`http.ClientResponse`]]

Emitted when a response is received to this request. This event is emitted only
once. 

Options include:

- host: a domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to
- port: the port of remote server
- socketPath: Unix Domain Socket (use either `host:port` or `socketPath`)




### http.ClientRequest@socket(socket)
- socket {net.Socket}   The assigned socket

Emitted after a socket is assigned to this request.


### http.ClientRequest@connect(response, socket, head)
- response {http.ClientResponse}  An instance of [[http.ClientResponse 
`http.ClientResponse`]]
- socket {net.Socket}  An instance of [[http.ClientResponse 
`http.ClientResponse`]]
- head {http.ClientResponse}  An instance of [[http.ClientResponse 
`http.ClientResponse`]]

Emitted each time a server responds to a request with a CONNECT method. If this
event isn't being listened for, clients receiving a CONNECT method will have
their connections closed.

#### Example: A client server pair that show you how to listen for the `connect` event.

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.clientrequest.connect.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>





### http.ClientRequest@upgrade(response, socket, head)
- response {http.ClientResponse}  The client's response
- socket {net.Socket}  The assigned socket
- head {Object}  The upgrade header

Emitted each time a server responds to a request with an upgrade. If this event
isn't being listened for, clients receiving an upgrade header will have their
connections closed.

#### Example

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/http/http.clientrequest.upgrade.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>


### http.ClientRequest@continue()

Emitted when the server sends a `'100 Continue'` HTTP response, usually because
the request contained `'Expect: 100-continue'`. This is an instruction that the
client should send the request body.




### http.ClientRequest.write(chunk [, encoding='utf8'])
- chunk {Buffer | String}  The buffer or string to write
- encoding {String}  The encoding of the chunk (only needed if it's a string)

Sends a chunk of the body.  By calling this method many times, the user can
stream a request body to a server—in that case, it's suggested you use the
`['Transfer-Encoding', 'chunked']` header line when creating the request.





### http.ClientRequest.end([data] [, encoding])
- data {String}  The data to send at the end
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use for the data 

Finishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are unsent, it will flush
them to the stream. If the request is chunked, this will send the terminating
`'0\r\n\r\n'`.

If `data` is specified, it is equivalent to calling `request.write(data,
encoding)` followed by `request.end()`.




### http.ClientRequest.abort()

Aborts a request, since NOde.js version 0.3.8.





### http.ClientRequest.setTimeout(timeout [, callback()])
- timeout {Number}  The timeout length, in milliseconds
- callback {Function}  An optional function to execute once the timeout
completes

Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected,
[[net.Socket.setTimeout `net.Socket.setTimeout()`]] is called.



### http.ClientRequest.setNoDelay([noDelay=true]) 
- noDelay {Boolean}  If `true`, then the data is fired off immediately each time
the socket is written

Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected,
[[net.Socket.setNoDelay `net.Socket.setNoDelay()`]] is called.



### http.ClientRequest.setSocketKeepAlive([enable=false] [, initialDelay])
- enable {Boolean}  If `true`, then keep-alive funcitonality is set
- initialDelay {Number}  Sets the initial delay before the first keep-alive probe
is sent on an idle socket

Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected,
[[net.Socket.setKeepAlive `net.Socket.setKeepAlive()`]] is called.




## http.ClientResponse

This object is created when making a request with [[http.request
`http.request()`]]. It is passed to the `'response'` event of the request
object.

The response implements the [[stream.ReadableStream `Readable Stream`]]
interface.



### http.ClientResponse@data(chunk)
- chunk {Buffer}  The data received

Emitted when a piece of the message body is received.




### http.ClientResponse@end(chunk)
- chunk {Buffer}  The data received

Emitted exactly once for each message. After it's emitted, no other events are
emitted on the response.




### http.ClientResponse@close(err)
- err {Error}  The error object

Indicates that the underlaying connection was terminated before the `end` event
was emitted.

For more information, see [[http.ServerRequest]]'s `'close'` event.



### http.ClientResponse.statusCode, Number

The 3-digit HTTP response status code, like `200`, `404`, e.t.c.




### http.ClientResponse.httpVersion, String

The HTTP version of the connected-to server. Usually either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`.
`response.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and `response.httpVersionMinor`
is the second.




### http.ClientResponse.header, Object

The response headers object.



### http.ClientResponse.trailers, Object

The response trailers object. Only populated after the `end` event.




### http.ClientResponse.setEncoding([encoding=null])
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use. Defaults to `null`, which means that
the `'data'` event will emit a `Buffer` object.

Set the encoding for the response body, either `'utf8'`, `'ascii'`, or
`'base64'`.
 



### http.ClientResponse.pause()

Pauses the response from emitting events.  Useful to throttle back a download.



### http.ClientResponse.resume()

Resumes a paused response.
