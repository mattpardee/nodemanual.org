## fs

> Stability: 3 - Stable

In Node.js, file input and output is provided by simple wrappers around standard
[POSIX functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX). All the read and write
methods methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms. To use this module,
include `require('fs')` in your code. 

The asynchronous form always take a completion callback as its last argument.
The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the
first argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was
completed successfully, then the first argument will be `null` or `undefined`.

When using the synchronous form, any exceptions are immediately thrown. You can
use `try/catch` to handle exceptions, or allow them to bubble up. 

In busy processes, the programmer is **strongly encouraged** to use the
asynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions block the entire
process until they completeâ€”halting all connections. However, with the
asynchronous methods, there is no guaranteed ordering.

Note: When processing files, relative paths to filename can be used; however, this path is relative to [[process.cwd `process.cwd()`]].

#### Example: An asynchronous file delete:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/fs/fs.ex.1.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

#### Example: A synchronous file delete:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/fs/fs.ex.2.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

#### Example: Handling timing issues with callback

Here's an example of the **wrong** way to perform more than one asynchronous
operation:

    fs.rename('/tmp/hello', '/tmp/world', function (err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('renamed complete');
    });
		// ERROR: THIS IS NOT CORRECT!
    fs.stat('/tmp/world', function (err, stats) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('stats: ' + JSON.stringify(stats));
    });

In the example above, it could be that `fs.stat` is executed before `fs.rename`.
The correct way to do this is to chain the callbacks, like this:

    fs.rename('/tmp/hello', '/tmp/world', function (err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      fs.stat('/tmp/world', function (err, stats) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('stats: ' + JSON.stringify(stats));
      });
    });

[open(2)](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/open.2.html). 

`flags` can be one of the following:

* `'r'`: Opens the file for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not
exist.

* `'r+'`: Opens the file for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the
file does not exist.

* `'rs'`: Open file for reading in synchronous mode. Instructs the operating
  system to bypass the local file system cache.

  This is primarily useful for opening files on NFS mounts as it allows you to
  skip the potentially stale local cache. It has a very real impact on I/O
  performance so don't use this mode unless you need it.

  Note that this doesn't turn `fs.open()` into a synchronous blocking call.
  If that's what you want, then you should be using `fs.openSync()`

* `'rs+'`: Open file for reading and writing, telling the OS to open it
  synchronously. See notes for `'rs'` about using this with caution.

* `'w'`: Opens the file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist)
or truncated (if it exists).

* `'wx'`: Like `'w'`, but opens the file in exclusive mode

* `'w+'`: Opens the file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it
doesn't exist) or truncated (if it exists).

* `'wx+'`: Like `'w+'` but opens the file in exclusive mode

* `'a'`: Opens the file for appending. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

* `'a+'`: Opens the file for reading and appending. The file is created if it
doesn't exist.

 * `'ax+'`: Like `'a+'` but opens the file in exclusive mode

Note: Exclusive mode (`O_EXCL`) ensures that `path` is newly created. `fs.open()`
fails if a file by that name already exists. On POSIX systems, symlinks are
not followed. Exclusive mode may or may not work with network file systems.

- path {String}  The path to the file
- flags {String}  A string indicating how to open the file

`flags` can be one of the following:

* `'r'`: Opens the file for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not
exist.

* `'r+'`: Opens the file for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the
file does not exist.

* `'w'`: Opens the file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist)
or truncated (if it exists).

* `'w+'`: Opens the file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it
doesn't exist) or truncated (if it exists).

* `'a'`: Opens the file for appending. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/fs/fs.writefile.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>
 



### fs.writeFileSync(filename, data, [encoding='utf8'])
- filename {String}  The name of the file to write to
- data {String | Buffer}  The data to write (this can be a string or a buffer)
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use (this is ignored if `data` is a buffer)

The synchronous version of [[fs.writeFile `fs.writeFile()`]].

 
### fs.appendFile(filename, data, encoding='utf8', [callback])
- filename {String}  The name of the file to write to
- data {String | Buffer}  The data to write (this can be a string or a buffer)
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use (this is ignored if `data` is a buffer)

Asynchronously append data to a file, creating the file if it does not yet exist.
`data` can be a string or a buffer. The `encoding` argument is ignored if
`data` is a buffer.

Example:

    fs.appendFile('message.txt', 'data to append', function (err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('The "data to append" was appended to file!');
    });

### fs.appendFileSync(filename, data, encoding='utf8')
- filename {String}  The name of the file to write to
- data {String | Buffer}  The data to write (this can be a string or a buffer)
- encoding {String}  The encoding to use (this is ignored if `data` is a buffer)

The synchronous version of [[fs.appendFile `appendFile()`]].

### fs.watchFile(filename, [options], callback(curr, prev))
- filename {String}  The name of the file to watch
- options {Object}   Any optional arguments indicating how often to watch
- listener {Function}   The callback to execute each time the file is accessed
- curr {fs.Stats}  The current `stats` object
- prev {fs.Stats}  The previous `stats` object

Watches for changes on `filename`. 

> Stability: 2 - Unstable.  Use fs.watch instead, if available.

`options`, if provided, should be an object containing two boolean members:
`persistent` and `interval`:
* `persistent` indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as
files are being watched; defaults to `true`
* `interval` indicates how often the target should be polled, in milliseconds; defaults to `5007`

On Linux systems with [inotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify),
`interval` is ignored.

#### Example

    fs.watchFile('message.text', function (curr, prev) {
      console.log('the current modification time is: ' + curr.mtime);
      console.log('the previous modification time was: ' + prev.mtime);
    });


 
### fs.unwatchFile(filename)
- filename {String}  The filename to watch

Stops watching for changes on `filename`.

> Stability: 2 - Unstable.  Use fs.watch instead, if available. 



### fs.watch(filename[, options], [callback(event, filename)]), fs.FSWatcher
- filename {String}  The filename (or directory) to watch
- options {Object}  An optional arguments indicating how to watch the files; defaults to `true`
- listener {Function}   The callback to execute each time the file is accessed
- event {String}  Either `'rename'` or '`change'`
- filename {String}  The name of the file which triggered the event

Watch for changes on `filename`.

> Stability: 2 - Unstable. Not available on all platforms. Use fs.watch instead, if available.

`options`, if provided, should be an object containing a boolean member
`persistent`, which indicates whether the process should continue to run as long
as files are being watched.

This feature depends on the underlying operating system providing a way
to be notified of filesystem changes.

* On Linux systems, this uses `inotify`.
* On BSD systems (including OS X), this uses `kqueue`.
* On SunOS systems (including Solaris and SmartOS), this uses `event ports`.
* On Windows systems, this feature depends on `ReadDirectoryChangesW`.

If the underlying functionality is not available for some reason, then
`fs.watch` will not be able to function.  You can still use
`fs.watchFile`, which uses stat polling, but it is slower and less
reliable.

#### Filename Argument

Warning: Providing the `filename` argument in the callback is not supported on
every platform (currently it's only supported on Linux and Windows).  Even on
supported platforms, `filename` is **not** always guaranteed to be provided.
Therefore, don't assume that `filename` argument is always provided in the
callback, and have some fallback logic if it is `null`, like in the provided
example.

#### Example

    fs.watch('somedir', function (event, filename) {
        console.log('event is: ' + event);
        if (filename) {
            console.log('filename provided: ' + filename);
        } else {
        console.log('filename not provided');
        }
    });

 
### fs.exists(path, [callback(exists)])
- path {String} The path to check
- callback {Function} An optional callback to execute once the function
completes
- exists {Boolean} `true` if the `path` exists

Tests whether or not the given path exists by checking with the file system.
Then calls the `callback` argument with either true or false.

#### Example

    fs.exists('/etc/passwd', function (exists) {
      util.debug(exists ? "it's there" : "no passwd!");
    });


### fs.existsSync(path)

Synchronous version of [[fs.exists `exists()`]].

### fs.createReadStream(path, [options]), fs.ReadStream
- path {String}  The path to read from
- options {Object}  Any optional arguments indicating how to read the stream


Returns a new [[fs.ReadStream `fs.ReadStream`]] object.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

    { 
      flags: 'r',
      encoding: null,
      fd: null,
      mode: 0666,
      bufferSize: 64 * 1024
    }

`options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from the
file instead of the entire file.  Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and start
at 0. The `encoding` can be `'utf8'`, `'ascii'`, or `'base64'`.

#### Example

Here's an example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:

    fs.createReadStream('sample.txt', {start: 90, end: 99});


 


### fs.createWriteStream(path, [options]), fs.WriteStream
- path {String}  The path to read from
- options {Object}   Any optional arguments indicating how to write the stream

Returns a new [[stream.WritableStream WriteStream]] object.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

    { flags: 'w',
      encoding: null,
      mode: 0666 }

`options` may also include a `start` option to allow writing data at some
position past the beginning of the file.  

Modifying a file rather than replacing it may require a `flags` mode of `r+`
rather than the default mode `w`.



## fs.Stats

Objects returned from [[fs.stat `fs.stat()`]], [[fs.lstat `fs.lstat()`]], and
[[fs.fstat `fs.fstat()`]] (and their synchronous counterparts) are of this type.
The object contains the following methods:

For a regular file, `util.inspect(fs.Stats)` returns an object similar to [the
structure returned by the Unix stat
command](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/stat.2.html):

    { dev: 2114,
      ino: 48064969,
      mode: 33188,
      nlink: 1,
      uid: 85,
      gid: 100,
      rdev: 0,
      size: 527,
      blksize: 4096,
      blocks: 8,
      atime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
      mtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
      ctime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT }


Please note that `atime`, `mtime`, and `ctime` are instances of the [[Date]]
object, and to compare the values of these objects you should use appropriate
methods. For most general uses, `Date.getTime()` returns the number of
milliseconds elapsed since _1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC_, and this integer
should be sufficient for any comparison. However, there are additional methods
which can be used for displaying fuzzy information.



### fs.Stats.isFile(), Boolean

Indicates if the object is a file.

 


### fs.Stats.isDirectory(), Boolean

Indicates if the object is a directory.


### fs.Stats.isBlockDevice(), Boolean

Indicates if the object is a [block
device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#Block_devices).

file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket).



## fs.WriteStream

This is a [[stream.WritableStream WriteStream]], created from the function
[[fs.createWriteStream `fs.createWriteStream()`]].

 


### fs.WriteStream@open(fd)
- fd {Number}   The file descriptor used by the `WriteStream`

- fd {Number}   The file descriptor used by the `ReadStream`

Emitted when a file is opened.

 



## fs.FSWatcher

Objects returned from [[fs.watch `fs.watch()`]] are of this type. You can
monitor any changes that occur on a watched file by listening for the events in
this object.


  


### fs.FSWatcher.close()

Stop watching for changes on the given `FSWatcher`.
 



### fs.FSWatcher@change(event, filename)
- event {String}  The event that occured, either `'rename'` or '`change'`
