/** 
class fs

In Node.js, file input and output is provided by simple wrappers around standard [POSIX functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX). All the read and write methods methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms. To use this module, include `require('fs')` in your code. 

The asynchronous form always take a completion callback as its last argument. The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the first argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was completed successfully, then the first argument will be `null` or `undefined`.

When using the synchronous form, any exceptions are immediately thrown. You can use `try/catch` to handle exceptions, or allow them to bubble up. 

In busy processes, the programmer is **strongly encouraged** to use the asynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions block the entire process until they completeâ€”halting all connections. However, with the asynchronous methods, there is no guaranteed ordering.

<Note>When processing files, relative paths to filename can be used; however, this path is relative to `process.cwd()`.</Note>

#### Example: An asynchronous file delete:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/fs/fs.ex.1.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

#### Example: A synchronous file delete:

<script src='http://snippets.nodemanual.org/github.com/mattpardee/nodemanual.org-examples/nodejs_ref_guide/fs/fs.ex.2.js?linestart=3&lineend=0&showlines=false' defer='defer'></script>

#### Example: Handling timing issues with callback

Here's an example of the **wrong** way to perform more than one asynchronous operation:

    fs.rename('/tmp/hello', '/tmp/world', function (err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('renamed complete');
    });
		// ERROR: THIS IS NOT CORRECT!
    fs.stat('/tmp/world', function (err, stats) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('stats: ' + JSON.stringify(stats));
    });

In the example above, it could be that `fs.stat` is executed before `fs.rename`. The correct way to do this is to chain the callbacks, like this:

    fs.rename('/tmp/hello', '/tmp/world', function (err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      fs.stat('/tmp/world', function (err, stats) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('stats: ' + JSON.stringify(stats));
      });
    });

- filename (String): The filename (or directory) to watch
- options (Object): An optional arguments indicating how to watch the files
- listener (Function):  The callback to execute each time the file is accessed
- event (String): Either `'rename'` or '`change'`
- filename (String): The name of the file which triggered the event


Watch for changes on `filename`.

`options`, if provided, should be an object containing a boolean member `persistent`, which indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched.

<Warning>Providing the `filename` argument in the callback is not supported on every platform (currently it's only supported on Linux and Windows).  Even on supported platforms, `filename` is **not** always guaranteed to be provided. Therefore, don't assume that `filename` argument is always provided in the callback, and have some fallback logic if it is `null`, like in the provided example.</Warning>

#### Example

    fs.watch('somedir', function (event, filename) {
        console.log('event is: ' + event);
        if (filename) {
            console.log('filename provided: ' + filename);
        } else {
        console.log('filename not provided');
        }
    });

/**
fs.createReadStream(path, [options]) -> fs.ReadStream
- path (String): The path to read from
- options (Object): Any optional arguments indicating how to read the stream


Returns a new [[fs.ReadStream `fs.ReadStream`]] object.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

    { 
      flags: 'r',
      encoding: null,
      fd: null,
      mode: 0666,
      bufferSize: 64 * 1024
    }

`options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from the file instead of the entire file.  Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and start at 0.

#### Example

Here's an example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:

    fs.createReadStream('sample.txt', {start: 90, end: 99});

/**
fs.createWriteStream(path, [options]) -> fs.WriteStream
- path (String): The path to read from
- options (Object):  Any optional arguments indicating how to write the stream

Returns a new [[streams.WriteStream WriteStream]] object.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

    { flags: 'w',
      encoding: null,
      mode: 0666 }

`options` may also include a `start` option to allow writing data at some position past the beginning of the file.  

Modifying a file rather than replacing it may require a `flags` mode of `r+` rather than the default mode `w`.
