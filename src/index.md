This website, Node.js Manual, offers a complete and community-driven resource for learning and developing Node.js applications. From the official [Node.js website](http://nodejs.org):

> _Node.js is a platform built on [Chrome's JavaScript runtime](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices._

This site consists of three different sections:

* The Node.js Reference helps you with the core Node.js modules and API
* The Node.js Manual contains articles to help you get started with Node.js
* The Javascript Reference helps you deal with the core Javascript API

This website is a community effort and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/c9/nodemanual.org). We expect the reference portion of the site to expand in parallel with the APIs of popular Node.js modules and extensions. The Node.js manual will grow with more articles on the Node.js core, tooling, techniques, and best practices. 

#### Contributing

You can help! After writing and updating articles, you can issue a pull request. Use the `[edit]` links near the article titles to edit them online using the [Cloud9 IDE](http://www.c9.io).
